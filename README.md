# Equation Solver

Welcome to the Equation Solver repository! This project is a simple calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as brackets and exponentiation.

## Features

The Equation Solver has the following features:

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), and division (/)
- Supports brackets to group operations and prioritize calculations
- Supports exponentiation (^) to calculate powers of numbers
- Provides results for inputted expressions

## How It Works

The Equation Solver uses the Shunting Yard algorithm to convert the input expression from infix notation to postfix notation, which is easier to evaluate. Once the expression is converted, it uses a stack to evaluate the expression, one token at a time. The result is then outputted to the user.

## Future Plans

I eventually plan to create an independent website for this, where user's will be able to test and mess around with the Equation Solver.

Thank you for your interest in the Equation Solver project!
